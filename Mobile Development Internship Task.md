# Mobile Development Intern 

DataOne Innovation Labs interview challenge for Mobile Development Intern - React Native  

This repository contains an intro challange for software engineers who want to join [DataOne Innovation Labs](http://dataone.io).

### So you want to prove you're worthy to join DataOne? Awesome!

You Need to Use React Native to Finish this task.

### Task description:

Your product manager would like you to explore the potential of a 
mobile "Public Toilet Finder App". Such an app could help travelers 
in a foreign country where they don't speak the language, or families with small children, 
to name but a few examples. To this end, he asks you to create an interactive prototype 
that can be used in on-site, moderated usability tests with users. 

Your manager would like to see the following use cases to be covered:

 - Find a suitable toilet nearbyâ€”for suitability, think about personal preferences, (small) children, people with impairments, paid or free,  etc.
 - Rate toilets and view ratings

 ### Hints:

Think about what fidelity makes sense

  -  Think about context of usage
  -  Think about necessary screens and user flows
  -  Think about what mobile devices to support in the prototype
  -  Think about how participants in the usability test will test the prototype

### Deliverables:

  -  Interactive prototype running on a mobile phone of your choice (feel free to use any software you see fit)
  -  Description of the creative process and rationale for decisions taken (what steps did you take? what decisions did you make, and why? etc.)

### How to Submit you task ?

- Create a zip file for this project and send us the google drive/dropbox link when you're done. 
- Organize your code according to project need.
- Must provide readme file with instructions to execute the project (It should work on any linux based machine)
